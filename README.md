# Thylacine
A simple Discord API

I am currently not accept any pull. I wish to develop this further on my own for a little longer. Hopefully not to far in the future (maybe a week) I will do a proper release with documentation then I'll help with bug reports. Its a hobby project you see ;)

Please be sure to check the Wiki for startup information and list of things still to do. I also have a list of endpoints that this library doesn't cover.
